-- Create admin user: sfudsss@sfu.ca with password: pandaspython
-- Note: In production, the password should be created via Supabase Dashboard
-- This is a placeholder script. The actual user creation happens through Supabase Auth.

-- After running this, you need to manually create the admin user via Supabase Dashboard or Auth API
-- with the email 'sfudsss@sfu.ca' and set metadata: { "is_admin": true }

-- This script just documents the requirement.
-- To create the user programmatically, use the Supabase Management API or do it manually in the dashboard.
